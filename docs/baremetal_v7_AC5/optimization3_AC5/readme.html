When compiling with NEON auto-vectorization, Arm Compiler 5 can compile the <span class="arg">moveSpark()</span> function to take advantage of NEON, so that calculations can be performed on 4 sparks in parallel at a time.  For example, for 0x1100 sparks, only 0x440 iterations of the loop are required.

        <div class="para">The calculations needed to create and move the Shells and Sparks in this example can be performed very quickly - most of the time to execute fireworks is taken by writing pixels to the display buffer in the <span class="arg">plot()</span> function.  To measure by how much the display is the performance bottleneck, try timing 10000 <span class="arg">drawSparks()</span> loops using the millisecond timer, using this code in the <span class="arg">fireworks()</span> function:</div>

<div class="para">This shows 10000 <span class="arg">drawSparks()</span> loops takes about 14 seconds on average.  These timings were for a BeagleBoard.  BeagleBoard-xM timings might be better.  If you do not have a serial terminal connected, set a breakpoint outside the <span class="arg">for()</span> loop, and view the global variable <span class="arg">tick_count</span>.</div>

}
</pre>
    <div class="para">
<span class="arg">__nop()</span> is an Arm Compiler intrinsic that compiles to a NOP instruction.  The compiler does not optimize away the NOP instructions (except for normal unreachable code elimination), so this ensures the <span class="arg">plot()</span> function is retained and not optimized away.  The <span class="arg">__nop()</span> intrinsic also acts as an instruction scheduling barrier, that ensures instructions are not moved from one side of the NOP to the other as a result of optimization.</div>
    <div class="para">Recompile, and run the code again.  No fireworks will appear on the display anymore because nothing is being written to it.  The 10000 <span class="arg">drawSparks()</span> loops now take about 3 seconds on average.  This demonstrates that about 20% of the time is being used to perform the calculations, and about 80% to write to the display.  Again, these timings were for a BeagleBoard.  BeagleBoard-xM timings might be better.</div>
