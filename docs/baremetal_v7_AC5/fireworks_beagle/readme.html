        <a name="Purpose_and_scope"></a><h2>Purpose and scope</h2>
        <div class="para">This example demonstrates the support for building and debugging Armv7-A bare-metal applications with Arm Compiler 5 and the Debugger.
        Fireworks is a full-featured bare-metal example written in C and assembler that produces a graphical simulated fireworks display and flying aeroplane banner on the screen.</div>
        <div class="para">This bare-metal fireworks example is specifically targeted at BeagleBoard and BeagleBoard-xM, complete with vector table, reset handler,
        interrupt handler, cache and MMU config, NEON support, interrupt controller and timer initialization, LCD screen driver, retargeted printf() output to a UART, etc.</div>

        <h3>Hardware and software requirements</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><div class="para">A BeagleBoard or BeagleBoard-xM and a suitable power supply for it.</div></li>
        <li><div class="para">DSTREAM or ULINK debug hardware and a suitable power supply for it, and a JTAG cable to connect it to BeagleBoard</div></li>
        <li><div class="para">Optionally, a standard computer LCD screen, connected via a DVI-D cable to BeagleBoard.
        The fireworks display can alternatively be viewed in the Debugger's <span class="interface">Screen</span> view.</div></li>
        <li><div class="para">A serial terminal emulator such as the Terminal view in Development Studio, PuTTY, TeraTerm, or Minicom for Linux, connected via a serial cable to your platform.
This may be needed when running the example on real target hardware, to monitor the Boot Loader and provide a serial terminal interface.  This is not needed if using a software model as that provides its own terminal.
To open the Terminal view in Development Studio, select <span class="menu">Window<span class="para"> → </span>Show View<span class="para"> → </span>Other...</span> to open the Show View dialog box, then expand the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> group and select <span class="interface">Terminal</span>, and click <span class="interface">OK</span>.
To configure the terminal settings, click on <span class="interface">Open a Terminal</span> in the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> view, then select the required connection type (for example, Serial Terminal), then enter the required settings (for example, 38400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) and click <span class="interface">OK</span>.

        Furthermore, any use of the printf() function in the application is output via the UART on the same serial connection.</div></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="para">This example is intended to be built with Arm Compiler 5. If you wish to modify and rebuild the example, you must use Arm Compiler 5 to rebuild it.</div>
        <div class="para">A pre-built executable (<span class="arg">fireworks_beagle.axf</span>) is provided.</div>

        <div class="para">For a good debug view, the compiler's optimization level is set to -O1 in the <span class="arg">makefile</span>.
         You can change this to raise the optimization level to -O2 or -O3 for higher performance code generation, but at the cost of a worse debug view.</div>

  given to the linker with the switch <span class="arg">--scatter=scatter.scat</span> places
  the vector table and other (assembler) startup code at 0x80000000, the main application (and library) code and data above that,
  then the application heap (<span class="arg">ARM_LIB_HEAP</span>), application stack (<span class="arg">ARM_LIB_STACK</span>), IRQ mode stack (<span class="arg">IRQ_STACK</span>),
  and MMU Translation Table Base (<span class="arg">TTB</span>) at fixed locations above that.  The screen frame buffer is placed at 0x80500000 (<span class="arg">FRAME_BUFFER</span>).
  The scatter-file can be viewed as plain text or in a graphical form showing the memory layout using the <span class="interface">Scatter File Editor</span>.</div>

        <h3>Retargeting</h3>
        <div class="para">All use of semihosting to set the top of stack, base of heap, output <span class="arg">printf()</span> strings and so on, has been retargeted by way of <span class="arg">ARM_LIB_STACKHEAP</span> in the scatter-file and <span class="arg">retarget.c</span>.
  The symbol <span class="arg">__use_no_semihosting</span> is referenced to ensure the executable contains no semihosting-using functions linked-in from the C library.
  No semihosting support is required by the executable, so semihosting does not need to be enabled in the Debugger.</div>

        <h3>Description of the Code Execution</h3>

  the linker switch <span class="arg">--entry=StartHere</span>.  The first instruction at the entry point perfoms a branch to the <span class="arg">Reset_Handler</span>.</div>
  <div class="para">The reset handler assigns the vector table, sets up stacks, sets up and enables MMU, enables NEON, then enters the C library via <span class="arg">__main()</span>.
  <span class="arg">__main()</span> performs all the necessary actions to setup the C/C++ runtime environment, for example, RW and ZI initialization and C library initialization.</div>
  <div class="para">The main fireworks application runs in <span class="arg">main()</span>.  Once program execution has reached <span class="arg">main()</span>, C/C++ code can be executed.
  <span class="arg">main()</span> starts by enabling the caches, then reading the BeagleBoard processor production code to determine the board version.
  If a BeagleBoard-xM is detected, the DVI is activated via the TPS65950 chipset using I2C.  <span class="arg">main()</span> then continues initializing,
  clearing the screen, initializing the timer, and enabling the IRQ input to the Arm core.
  Finally, it calls the <span class="arg">fireworks()</span> function, that fires "sparks" as fast as it can.</div>
  <div class="para">During the fireworks display, the timer is also ticking, generating interrupts.  On each interrupt, the LEDs are advanced one position.</div>
