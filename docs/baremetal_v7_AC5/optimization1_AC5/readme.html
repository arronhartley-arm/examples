        <div class="para">This example introduces some basic code size and performance optimization and measurement techniques for application software 
        using Arm Compiler 5, and is illustrated by a simple example bare-metal "sorts" application.
        It introduces the essential compiler switches required to build your application, so that the compiler can do most of the work of
        optimizing your application, with no source code changes needed by you.
        The example demonstrates the use of features of Arm Compiler 5 to measure code and data sizes, and includes the use of the 
        Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) on the target for measuring performance.</div>

        <h3>Hardware and software requirements</h3>
        <ul>
           <li><div class="para">A BeagleBoard or BeagleBoard-xM and a suitable power supply for it.</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">DSTREAM or ULINK debug hardware and a suitable power supply for it, and a JTAG cable to connect it to BeagleBoard</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">A serial terminal emulator such as the Terminal view in Development Studio, PuTTY, TeraTerm, or Minicom for Linux, connected via a serial cable to your platform.
This may be needed when running the example on real target hardware, to monitor the Boot Loader and provide a serial terminal interface.  This is not needed if using a software model as that provides its own terminal.
To open the Terminal view in Development Studio, select <span class="menu">Window<span class="para"> → </span>Show View<span class="para"> → </span>Other...</span> to open the Show View dialog box, then expand the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> group and select <span class="interface">Terminal</span>, and click <span class="interface">OK</span>.
To configure the terminal settings, click on <span class="interface">Open a Terminal</span> in the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> view, then select the required connection type (for example, Serial Terminal), then enter the required settings (for example, 38400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) and click <span class="interface">OK</span>.

        <ol>
        <li>
        <div class="para">If your target has a cache, ensure it is enabled.  Example startup code that sets up a cache and MMU for Cortex-A8 on BeagleBoard is provided in <span class="arg">startup.s</span>.  To ensure cache coherency, it is normal to enable the cache after the C run-time region environment setup (scatterloading) has been performed, typically inside <span class="arg">main()</span>.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
        <div class="para">When building for v6 or later, Arm Compiler 5 assumes the target supports unaligned accesses with no alignment fault checking, so ensure your target's startup code configures CP15 System Control Register c1 to:</div>
        <ul>
        <li><div class="para">set U bit 22 to enable unaligned accesses (this is the default for Armv7-A cores)</div></li>
        <li><div class="para">clear A bit 1 to disable strict alignment fault checking</div></li>
        </ul>
		<div class="para">These are normally done together with setting M bit 0 to enable the MMU.  These are shown in the example <span class="arg">startup.s</span>.</div>
		<div class="para">To avoid Arm Compiler 5 generating unaligned accesses from C/C++ code, as a last resort you can compile and assemble with <span class="arg">--no_unaligned_accesses</span>.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
        <div class="para">If your application's <span class="arg">main()</span> function cannot be changed (for example, if it is pre-built legacy code, or it is a benchmark program such as Dhrystone that must not be modified), then the Arm linker's <span class="arg">$Sub$$/$Super$$</span> feature can be used to 'patch' an existing <span class="arg">main()</span>.  This feature is illustrated in the accompanying example.  <span class="arg">sorts.c</span> has a <span class="arg">main()</span>, but also <span class="arg">perf.c</span> has a <span class="arg">main()</span>.  <span class="arg">perf.c</span>'s <span class="arg">main()</span> must be executed first to enable the cache, set-up the Performance Counters (see later), and then 'chain' onto the <span class="arg">main()</span> in <span class="arg">sorts.c</span>.</div>

        <div class="para">Ensure you compile for an appropriate CPU, typically either the specific core on your target, for example, <span class="arg">--cpu=Cortex-A8</span>
		or, if you need to compile code (for example, common library code) to run on a range of different targets, then compile for the lowest common denominator architecture, for example: <span class="arg">--cpu=7-A</span>.</div>
		<div class="para">Note: Be aware that with some <span class="arg">--cpu</span> selections, the presence of an FPU is implicit, and with others it is explicit.  For example, <span class="arg">--cpu=Cortex-A8</span> assumes the presence of NEON/VFP, whereas <span class="arg">--cpu=Cortex-A8.no_neon</span> explicitly specifies its absence.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
        <div class="para">Select an appropriate optimization level, one of <span class="arg">-O0</span> (the lowest), <span class="arg">-O1</span> (good for debug), <span class="arg">-O2</span> (the default) or <span class="arg">-O3</span> (most aggressive).  The lower optimization levels are more suitable when debugging, for a better debug illusion.
		As the optimization level is increased, more optimizations are enabled in the compiler, for example auto-inlining is enabled at <span class="arg">-O2</span> and <span class="arg">-O3</span>.</div>

        <div class="para">Decide on whether your code should run in Arm state (compile with <span class="arg">--arm</span>) or Thumb state (compile with <span class="arg">--thumb</span>).  This decision may depend on whether your priority is on code size or performance.  For Cortex-A-series cores, which support Thumb, compiling with <span class="arg">--thumb</span> will give the best of both worlds.  <span class="arg">--apcs=/interwork</span> will be needed if mixing Arm and Thumb code on earlier cores.</div>

        <li><div class="para">
<span class="arg">fromelf -z</span> provides a breakdown of the size of an ELF object file or ELF image</div></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="para">Note: at link time, armlink will remove unused sections automatically.  
        To see if any sections are removed, use <span class="arg">armlink --info=unused</span>.
        armlink will also compress RW data by default, if sensible to do so.  For information about any compression applied, use <span class="arg">armlink --info=compression</span>.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
        <div class="para">Measuring performance involves running your code on a target, either on real hardware or on a software model (such as the FVP models).
		The use of ETM/PTM/ETB to trace instruction execution and measure times can work well, but a straightforward approach that does not require any additional hardware is to use the hardware Performance Counters (also known as Performance Monitoring Units PMU) built into the core.  Boiler-plate code, which you can include in your own applications, is provided in <span class="arg">perf.c</span>.  For Arm Linux applications, use the Arm Streamline Performance Analyser to show the performance of your application as a part of the whole system environment.</div>

        It is good coding practice to mark functions as <span class="arg">static</span> if they will only be used in the current compilation unit because the compiler
