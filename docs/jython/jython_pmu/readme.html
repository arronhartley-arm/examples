        <div class="para">This example illustrates the use of a Jython script in the Debugger to use the Performance Monitor Unit (PMU) to count
elapsed cycles, and user-defined events, between two points in program execution.
It places a breakpoint on the start and end of an execution range (either a function, or range of addresses), runs to the first breakpoint, sets up the PMU counters, runs to the second breakpoint, and reads the elapsed counts.
        This example is intended to illustrate features of the Debugger - it is not intended to be a tutorial on Jython.</div>

        <a name="Using_the_example"></a><h2>Using the example</h2>
        <div class="para">To use this example, first connect the Debugger to a target in the normal way.  Ensure the code you wish to analyze is loaded on the target and, to analyze a function by name, that debug symbols are loaded into the Debugger.  Then run the <span class="arg">pmu.py</span> Jython script in one of the following ways:</div>
        <div class="para">In the <span class="interface">Command</span> field of the <span class="interface">Command</span> view, enter the <span class="arg">source</span> command to run <span class="arg">pmu.py</span>, for example:</div>
<pre class="code">
source jython_pmu/pmu.py -h

Performance Monitor Unit (PMU) Analyzer v2021.1
Usage: pmu [options]
Options:
-range        Address range e.g. 0x8000000 0x81000000
-func         Name of function e.g. main (symbols must first be loaded into the Debugger)
-c            Enable Cycle Counter (CCNT)
-e            Events to monitor e.g. CPU_CYCLES,MEM_ACCESS
-u            Enable User mode access to PMU (must be executed in a privileged mode)
-d            Enable CCNT divider 1/64
-l            List available events for current target
-h            Print this help

            <li><div class="para">This script is intended to work with real hardware that implements the PMU counters. It does not work with software models (FVP) that do not implement the PMU counters.</div></li>

            <li><div class="para">To allow function names to be specified with -func, debug symbols must have been be loaded into the Debugger.</div></li>
            <li><div class="para">For functions, the script relies on the address in LR to trap the end of the function.  Beware that this simple approach does not correctly handle functions that are inlined.  You may need to disable inlining in your compiler to resolve this.</div></li>
            <li><div class="para">For static (file scope) functions, the name of the function must be prefixed with the name of the compilation unit within escaped quotes, for example, <span class="arg">-func \"sorts.c\"::insert_sort</span>.  The quotes must be escaped to allow the quotes to be passed from the CLI to the script.</div></li>
            <li><div class="para">The script can be run directly in a privileged mode.  The script can also be run in user mode if user mode access to PMU is enabled before the script is run (though this enabling has to be done in privileged mode).</div></li>
