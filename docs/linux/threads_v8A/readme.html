        <a name="Purpose_and_scope"></a><h2>Purpose and scope</h2>
        <div class="para">The "threads" example is a simple console-based Linux application that can be used to illustrate the support for debug of multi-threaded Armv8-A Linux applications in the Debugger.
        The Linux target used in this example is either a pre-built Linux distribution running on an Armv8-A Foundation Platform model, or the Arm Juno platform.
        Remote System Explorer (RSE) in the Debugger is used to connect to and communicate with Linux running on the target.
        RSE enables you to copy source files to the target, compile them on the target, and debug them within the Debugger.</div>

        <div class="para">This example uses a network port to connect between the host machine and the Armv8-A Foundation Platform model.  You must choose a (currently unused) port to use.
         You can use "netstat -an" to identify a free port on your host machine.  This example uses port number "12345" in the descriptions below.</div>

        <div class="para">This example's files can be found in the <span class="arg">...\threads_v8A</span> directory within <span class="arg">Linux_examples.zip</span>.</div>

        <div class="para">The example uses "pthreads" (the Native POSIX Threads Library), that is, it uses the pthread_*() family of functions,
        and is compiled with "-pthreads".  This example creates some threads with pthread_create(), gives them some work to do
        (accumulating a float result in a loop), then waits for them to finish with pthread_join().</div>
        <div class="para">It demonstrates the capabilities of the Debugger to allow you to:</div>
        <ul>
           <li><div class="para">View thread status (in the GUI, and with the "info threads" command)</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">Set current thread (in the GUI, and with the "thread" command)</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">Refer to current thread number in commands (with the "$thread" debugger variable)</div></li>

</div></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="para">This example is intended to show off features of the Debugger - it is not intended to be a tutorial on multi-threading, so thread scheduling, synchronisation, mutexes, signal handling and condition variables are not discussed.</div>
        <div class="para">Note that when a thread is stopped by the debug system, all threads stop.  When a thread is restarted, all threads restart.  There is no way to selectively start/stop individual threads in isolation from the others.</div>

        <h3>Hardware and software requirements</h3>
        <div class="para">A host workstation (Linux or Windows) with Python3 and Development Studio installed is required.</div>

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <div class="para">This document discusses 'host' and 'target' systems. The 'host' system is the Linux or Windows desktop computer that you use for most of your work.
        The 'target' system is some Arm-based hardware (or model of such hardware) on which Arm Linux is running.</div>

<div class="para">The threads example normally runs to completion very quickly.  To allow time to attach the debugger, add a simple control flag,

volatile int stop=1;  // Enable attaching a debugger
