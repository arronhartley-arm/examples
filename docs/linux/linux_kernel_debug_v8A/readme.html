        <a name="Purpose_and_scope"></a><h2>Purpose and scope</h2>
        <div class="para">To develop, port and debug the Linux kernel on a platform, you will need to be able to set breakpoints, view registers, view memory, single-step at source level and so on -
        all the normal facilities provided by a debugger.  You may also need to do these both <span class="italic">before</span> the MMU is enabled (with a physical memory map), and <span class="italic">after</span>
        the MMU is enabled (with a virtual memory map).  The Debugger allows you to do all this and more, not just for single-core platforms, but for multi-core SMP platforms too.</div>
        <div class="para">This tutorial shows how to debug the Armv8-A Linux kernel in a multi-core SMP system with the Debugger.
        The Linux target used here is a pre-built Linux distribution running on an Armv8-A Base Platform model, but a real Arm Linux hardware platform could also be used.</div>
        <div class="para">The Armv8-A Base Platform model and Armv8-A Linux kernel (pre-built for debug, complete with vmlinux symbol file, file system and source tree) are both available as downloads (see below).
        The boot loader used here is the Trusted Firmware and U-Boot.</div>

        <div class="para">This tutorial demonstrates the capabilities of the Debugger to allow you to:</div>
        <ul>
           <li><div class="para">Debug the kernel before the MMU is enabled (with a physical memory map)</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">Debug the kernel after the MMU is enabled (with a virtual memory map)</div></li>

        <h3>Hardware and software requirements</h3>

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <div class="para">This document discusses 'host' and 'target' systems. The 'host' system is the Linux or Windows desktop computer that you use for most of your work.
        The 'target' system is some Arm-based hardware (or model of such hardware) on which Arm Linux is running.</div>

            and the virtual address read from the ELF header of the vmlinux file.
            The physical address at which the kernel is loaded comes from the model parameter: <span class="arg">--data cluster0.cpu0=Image@0x80080000</span>.
