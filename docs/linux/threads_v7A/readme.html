        <a name="Purpose_and_scope"></a><h2>Purpose and scope</h2>
        <div class="para">This example illustrates the support for debug of multi-threaded Arm Linux applications in the Debugger.  This is a simple
        console-based example that can run on any Linux target supported by Development Studio.</div>

        <div class="para">This example's files can be found in the <span class="arg">...\threads_v7A</span> directory within <span class="arg">Linux_examples.zip</span>.</div>

        <div class="note"><div class="para">
<div class="bold">Note</div>This example is intended to be built with Linaro arm-linux-gnueabihf GCC.  If you wish to modify and rebuild the example, you must have Linaro arm-linux-gnueabihf GCC installed.  Linaro arm-linux-gnueabihf GCC is not supplied with Development Studio, but can be downloaded from the Linaro web-site (see below).</div></div>

        <div class="para">The example uses "pthreads" (the Native POSIX Threads Library), that is, it uses the pthread_*() family of functions,
        and is compiled with "-pthreads".  This example creates some threads with pthread_create(), gives them some work to do
        (accumulating a float result in a loop), then waits for them to finish with pthread_join().</div>
        <div class="para">It demonstrates the capabilities of the Debugger to allow you to:</div>
        <ul>
           <li><div class="para">View thread status (in the GUI, and with the "info threads" command)</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">Set current thread (in the GUI, and with the "thread" command)</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">Refer to current thread number in commands (with the "$thread" debugger variable)</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">View the call stack of any thread</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">View local variables for any thread</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">Set a breakpoint on a thread</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">Set a conditional breakpoint on a thread</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">Connect to an already-running multi-threaded application, then debug it via <span class="arg">gdbserver --attach</span>
</div></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="para">This example is intended to show off features of the Debugger - it is not intended to be a tutorial on multi-threading, so thread scheduling, synchronisation, mutexes, signal handling and condition variables are not discussed.</div>
        <div class="para">Note that when a thread is stopped by the debug system, all threads stop.  When a thread is restarted, all threads restart.  There is no way to selectively start/stop individual threads in isolation from the others.</div>

        <h3>Hardware and software requirements</h3>
        <div class="para">A host workstation (Linux or Windows) is required to build the example, communicate with the target, and run the Debugger.</div>
        <div class="para">The following software may also be needed on the host to run and debug the example:</div>
        <ul>
           <li><div class="para">A serial terminal emulator such as the Terminal view in Development Studio, PuTTY, TeraTerm, or Minicom for Linux, connected via a serial cable to your platform.
This may be needed when running the example on real target hardware, to monitor the Arm Linux boot process and provide a terminal interface to Arm Linux.  This is not needed if using a software model as that provides its own terminal.
To open the Terminal view in Development Studio, select <span class="menu">Window<span class="para"> → </span>Show View<span class="para"> → </span>Other...</span> to open the Show View dialog box, then expand the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> group and select <span class="interface">Terminal</span>, and click <span class="interface">OK</span>.
To configure the terminal settings, click on <span class="interface">Open a Terminal</span> in the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> view, then select the required connection type (for example, Serial Terminal), then enter the required settings (for example, 38400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) and click <span class="interface">OK</span>.
</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">A secure copy program such as <span class="arg">scp</span>, needed to allow files to be copied from host to target.
           Windows versions of this Linux command are available, such as <span class="arg">pscp</span> as provided with <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" title="External link"><i>PuTTY</i></a>.
           Alternatively, use the Debugger's Debug Configurations dialog box or Remote System Explorer to transfer files from host to target.</div></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <div class="para">This document discusses 'host' and 'target' systems. The 'host' system is the Linux or Windows desktop computer that you use for most of your work.
        The 'target' system is some Arm-based hardware (or model of such hardware) on which the example Arm Linux distribution is running.</div>
