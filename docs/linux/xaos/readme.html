        <a name="Purpose_and_scope"></a><h2>Purpose and scope</h2>
        <div class="para">This document describes how to build, run and analyze the Xaos example provided with Development Studio.
        Xaos is an interactive fractal zoomer application, as described on the <a href="http://matek.hu/xaos/doku.php" title="External link"><i>Xaos web site</i></a>.
        This example uses Xaos version 3.5 - the source code is downloadable from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xaos/files/XaoS/3.5/xaos-3.5.tar.gz/download" title="External link"><i>SourceForge</i></a>.
        Some small additions and changes have been made to the original sources by Arm Ltd to illustrate Streamline annotation support.  Changes are marked with "Arm Ltd" to allow them to be easily found.</div>

        <div class="para">This example's files can be found in the <span class="arg">...\xaos</span> directory within <span class="arg">Linux_examples.zip</span>.  Import this .zip archive into your workspace to access the <span class="arg">xaos</span> project.</div>

        <div class="note"><div class="para">
<div class="bold">Note</div>This example is intended to be built with Linaro arm-linux-gnueabihf GCC.  If you wish to modify and rebuild the example, you must have Linaro arm-linux-gnueabihf GCC installed.  Linaro arm-linux-gnueabihf GCC is not supplied with Development Studio, but can be downloaded from the Linaro web-site (see below).</div></div>

        <div class="para">Pre-built executables are provided that can be used to run and debug the example.
        To rebuild this example, you must import into your workspace the "Linux Distribution Example" package that can be downloaded from the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/embedded/legacy-tools/ds-5-development-studio/downloads" title="External link"><i>Downloads on developer.arm.com</i></a>.
        This provides the example Linux <span class="arg">distribution</span> project/directory, and headers and libraries that are compatible with the example Linux distribution.</div>

        <div class="para">This example is intended to be run and analyzed on an Arm Linux hardware target that supports Streamline, though it can also be run only (not analyzed with Streamline) on a software model such as the FVP model of Versatile Express with Cortex-A9x1 Core Tile (Cortex-A9x1 FVP model).</div>
        <div class="para">Example Streamline capture data for Xaos is provided in the Streamline examples.</div>

        <div class="para">The ready-made Streamline capture for this example can be viewed in Streamline using the <span class="interface">Import Streamline Sample Captures</span> wizard.
        To view the ready-made Streamline capture, first launch the Streamline application, then import the capture for this example 
        by selecting <span class="menu">File<span class="para"> → </span>Import...</span>, <span class="interface">Import Streamline Sample Captures</span>,
        then selecting <span class="menu">Linux<span class="para"> → </span>Arm DS Xaos Example</span> from the list of sample captures.
        The capture is added to the <span class="interface">Streamline Data</span> view, appearing as "Linux - TC2 - Xaos".  Double-click on the capture to generate and view an Analysis Report.</div>

        <div class="para">The example Streamline Capture Data provided was captured from Xaos being run
        multi-threaded (with 5 threads) on a Versatile Express Cortex-A15x2+A7x3 ("TC2") big.LITTLE platform.
        Click on the (xaos) process to show its 5 threads and view the annotations ("main init", "compute fractal", "update display").
        Select X-Ray mode to view the CPU core affinity, to see which threads are running on which core/cluster at any moment.</div>

        <div class="para">By default, no libraries (.so) are specified in the <span class="interface">Program Images</span> of the Analysis Report generation dialog, so the Analysis Report gives information
        about all libraries being accessed, but not their contents.  By specifying a library in the Analysis Report generation dialog, the
        function calls into that library are then revealed in the Analysis Report.  The library does not need to be a full debug info library - just
        having function names in its symbol table is sufficient.  For full visibility of a library's internals, a debug version of the library (not
        provided in Development Studio) would need to be specified.
        For example, <span class="arg">libpthread.so</span> is frequently used/called in the multi-threaded Xaos, and has a relatively small number of distinct
        functions (as compared to, say, libc).  To view the calls/usage of libpthread.so, specify the library such as <span class="arg">libpthread-2.17.so</span>
        in the Analysis Report generation dialog.  This library must be a copy on your host computer of the file in your Arm Linux target's file system, such as those in your workspace in <span class="arg">distribution\filesystem\linaro_hf\lib</span>.</div>

        <div class="para">Linux kernel symbols can also be tracked in the same way by specifying the appropriate <span class="arg">vmlinux</span> for your kernel in <span class="interface">Program Images</span>.</div>

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <div class="para">This document refers to 'host' and 'target' systems. The 'host' system is the Linux or Windows desktop computer that you use for most of your work.
        The 'target' system is some Arm-based hardware (or model of such hardware) on which the example Arm Linux distribution is running.</div>

        <h3>Hardware and software requirements</h3>
        <ul>
           <li><div class="para">A host workstation (Linux or Windows) is required to build the example, communicate with the target, and run the Debugger.</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">An Arm Linux hardware target, configured for Streamline (with gator driver and daemon).</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">A local display device (for example, an LCD monitor) connected directly to your board,
           or a remote display such as an Exceed or Xming X server running on the host workstation.</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">A serial terminal emulator such as the Terminal view in Development Studio, PuTTY, TeraTerm, or Minicom for Linux, connected via a serial cable to your platform.
This may be needed when running the example on real target hardware, to monitor the Arm Linux boot process and provide a terminal interface to Arm Linux.  This is not needed if using a software model as that provides its own terminal.
To open the Terminal view in Development Studio, select <span class="menu">Window<span class="para"> → </span>Show View<span class="para"> → </span>Other...</span> to open the Show View dialog box, then expand the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> group and select <span class="interface">Terminal</span>, and click <span class="interface">OK</span>.
To configure the terminal settings, click on <span class="interface">Open a Terminal</span> in the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> view, then select the required connection type (for example, Serial Terminal), then enter the required settings (for example, 38400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) and click <span class="interface">OK</span>.
</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">A secure copy program such as <span class="arg">scp</span> to allow files to be copied from host to target.
           Windows versions of this Linux command are available, such as <span class="arg">pscp</span> as provided with <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" title="External link"><i>PuTTY</i></a>.
           Alternatively, use the Debugger's Debug Configurations dialog or Remote System Explorer to transfer files from host to target.</div></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="para">Xaos is a graphical application in a windowing environment, so a mouse should preferably be connected to the target in addition to a normal keyboard.
        If using the Cortex-A9x1 FVP model on the host, the mouse and keyboard of the host can be used to control the Xaos application.</div>
